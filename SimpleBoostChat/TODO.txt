THE MOST IMPORTANT !!!
========================
Each session participant must run within its own strand, otherwise receiving and writting wont be queued
========================

ERROR:



Segmentation fault of vector: check if beuffer isn't destroyed before accesd by boost::asio::write or read ||| there was a problem with uninitialized smart_ptrs and passing shared_ptr between functions











? should ChatMessage have validation function?





Further thoughts:
- is everything really thread safe?
- can the server be run on multiply threads or just one? |||| one thread for one server for one port
- should the participants' actions be run on their own boost::strands?
