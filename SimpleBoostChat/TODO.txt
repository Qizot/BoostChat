THE MOST IMPORTANT !!!
==============================================
Implement header sending in new Message class!
==============================================






1. Documentation

2. MESSAGES should be transfered via shared_ptr, the message won't be copied and it also wont be destroyed after poping it from the queue while some session is sending it
3. shared_from_this can only be called when the object has been constructed as shared_ptr
4. what about strand per participant?

1. Don't send messages to the user that just have sent the msg
2. Implement disconnect system for the client if server doesn't respond




? If participant copies the message and there are a lot of them should the messages have characters limit and if so what the limit should be [proposal: 4096]
? should ChatMessage have validation function?





Further thoughts:
- is everything really thread safe?
- can the server be run on multiply threads or just one? |||| one thread for one server for one port
- should the participants' actions be run on their own boost::strands?
