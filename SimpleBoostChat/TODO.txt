1. Constructor for Basic_message to automatically create the header after loading the string object
2. Constructor for ChatMessage to parse nick nad msg context and invoke header_create

? If participant copies the message and there are a lot of them should the messages have characters limit and if so what the limit should be [proposal: 4096]


ERROR:
-there is 100% data race, the option is: copy message every time when its needed or keep playing with it and make thread-safe data structures(good for practice when I get time)
write code and then debug it(as well for practice)


Further thoughts:
- is everything really thread safe?
- can the server be run on multiply threads or just one?
- should the participants' actions be run on their own boost::strands?
